## Workshop

### Goals

* Deploy a Flask application to AWS Lambda
* Attach a custom domain with SSL certificate
* Add HTML template to the Flask application
* Add Login with Facebook
* Use mako templating language to fill elements fetched from DynamoDB.
* Setup static file serving directly from S3 and not the flask application.

### Bonus
* Use Locust performance testing framework to measure response times while increasing user count.
* Repeat the test with caching in API Gateway enabled, to see how it affects response time.
